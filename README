Let's consider a libtool/autoconf project where source and build directories are separeted:
  source_dir
  source_dir/build

If you're editing a file in source_dir/src and type Make then
  1/ the name of the build directory will be asked (here 'build') (it is asked only once)
  2/ :make will be run in source_dir/build/src

source_dir is found by searching for configure.ac, configure.in or configure

The following additional commands are defined:
   Compile - compiles the current file by calling the libtool-specific
           :make basename.lo
   MakeAll - runs :make in source_dir regardless of the directory of the current file
   Reconfigure - runs "config.status --recheck" in source_dir/build
   RegenAll - runs "config.status" in source_dir/build
   Run execname - starts execname instead of :make
   Debug execname - start a libtool-wrapped gdb (for libtool generated executables)
